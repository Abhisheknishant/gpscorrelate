# Strip paths & version number. Also, move the Warning: line(s) to the end of
# the file so they are in a known location (carefully, especially with edge
# cases like the line already appearing at the end of the file), since the
# blending of stdout/stderr is done differently on different platforms.
# Unfortunately, BSD sed doesn't support grouping commands with {}.
